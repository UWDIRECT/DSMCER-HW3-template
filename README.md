## Homework 3 DSMCER

### Description and purpose

The purpose of HW3 is to give you practice with the statistical methods we have reviewed over the last 3 lectures:  calculating descriptive statistics, distributions, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.  

A secondary goal is to give you further practice with data visualization

### Instructions

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW3. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, check back in your work. I will check out your completed work and grade it with a GitHub issue as before.

Note that I must be able to execute all cells in the notebook starting from top to bottom. I will "clear all output" from your notebook and then execute it all in order to make sure the notebook works.

### A note about comments

Comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things.
