## Homework 3 DSMCER

### Description and purpose

The purpose of HW3 is to give you practice making choices for preprocessing data to be used for supervised machine learning to accomplish a specific goal.

### Instructions

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW3. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, check back in your work.

Note that we must be able to execute all cells in the notebook starting from top to bottom. I will "clear all output" from your notebook and then execute it all in order to make sure the notebook works.

### A note about comments

Comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things.
